# Reg-puchi

# Motivation

Regular Expressions are so cute  (｀・ω・´ )/

That is why this repository is to my best effort dedicated for embracing them.

# Features

* Automaton & Tree Visualization with GraphViz

* Supports from monadic parser combinator

* [NFA -> NDF] -> under maintanance

* [Translation to vm code] -> under maintanance

## Example yet another shell command on my own regular expression is added.

### awk (15%)

### sed (5%)

### grep ..
