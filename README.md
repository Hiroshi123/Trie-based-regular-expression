# Reg-puchi

# Motivation

Regular Expressions are so cute  (｀・ω・´ )/

That is why this repository is to my best effort dedicated for embracing them.

# Features

### Towards regular expression itself

* Automaton & Tree Visualization with GraphViz

* Supports from monadic parser combinator [docs](https://github.com/Hiroshi123/reg-puchi/blob/master/docs/regvspsc.md)

* NFA to NDF -> under maintanance

* Translation to vm code [docs](https://github.com/Hiroshi123/reg-puchi/blob/master/docs/regvm.md)

### Towards its application

* awk :: [docs] ()

* sed :: [docs] ()

* grep :: [docs] ()

# Documentation

Rather being called solid documentations,
there are some notes about my thoughts on this topic.

Check `./docs/` out.

# Example

* awk
* sed
* grep

### any reg-expression-heavily-dependent commands will be added.
